# Employee Directory

- Dynamically searchable directory; Users can lookup employees by name and find their information in a modal window.
- Uses the Fetch API to pull hypothetical data for displaying employee photos and information, which I then use string manipulation to format the data correctly.
- Users can also cycle through employees within the modal window.

## TODO

- [ ] Refactor entire project with an emphasis on clean code
- [ ] Replace jQuery instances with JS or ONLY use jQuery for consistency
